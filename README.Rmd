# pkgattrs

The goal of pkgattrs is to get information on the contents of an R package. So far, we can obtain a summary of functions available in one or more packages using the `get_pkg_fcn_info()` function. Here is an example that gets information about the functions in the `pkgattrs` and `blastula` packages that are hosted on GitHub.

```{r}
library(pkgattrs)

fcn_info <-
  get_pkg_fcn_info(
    from_github("rich-iannone/pkgattrs"),
    from_github("rich-iannone/blastula"))
```

The resulting tibble contains the following information in each record:

- the package name (`pkg_name`)
- the function name (`fcn_name`)
- the file that contains the function (`r_file`)
- the line number in `r_file` where the function starts (`ln_start`) and ends (`ln_end`)
- the number of lines used for the function (`lines`)
- whether the function is exported or not (`exported`)
- the number of package functions that are called in `fcn_name` (`n_pkg_fcns_called`)
- a list column with the names of the package functions called in `fcn_name` (`pkg_fcns_called`)

```{r}
fcn_info
```

The package also supplies functions for visualizing the relationships between a package's functions as a network graph. For example, we could obtain a function information tibble for the **rmarkdown** package, transform that to a graph, and then examine which package functions are associated with the `render()` function

```{r eval=FALSE}
get_pkg_fcn_info(from_github("rstudio/rmarkdown")) %>%
  create_function_graph() %>%
  show_called_functions(caller_fcn = "render")
```

<img src="man/figures/rmarkdown_render_network_diagram.png">

In this graph, the green nodes show the functions that are exported, and, the relative sizing of nodes is scaled the number of package functions called by each. Each edge represents the relationship `called_in`.

## Installation

You can install pkgattrs from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rich-iannone/pkgattrs")
```
