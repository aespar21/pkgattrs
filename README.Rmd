# pkgattrs

The goal of pkgattrs is to get information on the contents of an R package. So far, we can obtain of summary of functions available in a package using the `get_pkg_fcn_info()` function. Here is an example of that for the `blastula` package.

```{r}
library(pkgattrs)

blastula_fcn_info <-
  get_pkg_fcn_info(pkg_location = "~/Documents/R_oss_work/blastula/")
```

The resulting tibble contains a line for every function, which file each is located, starting/ending line numbers, and more.

```{r}
blastula_fcn_info
```

## Installation

You can install pkgattrs from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rich-iannone/pkgattrs")
```
